  <p>Tigrillo is a traditional Ecuadorian dish made from green plantains that are mashed and mixed with cheese and other ingredients. This flavorful and comforting dish is often enjoyed as a breakfast or brunch option, and it's popular in coastal regions of Ecuador.

  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>3-4 green plantains, peeled and chopped into chunks</ul>
    <ul>1 cup grated cheese (queso fresco or a similar white cheese)</ul>
    <ul>1 small onion, finely chopped</ul>
    <ul>2 tablespoons butter or oil</ul>
    <ul>1/2 cup milk</ul>
    <ul>Salt and pepper, to taste</ul>
    <ul>Optional: cooked scrambled eggs, cooked chorizo or sausage, avocado slices, aji hot sauce for serving</ul>
  <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>Prepare the Plantains: Peel the green plantains and chop them into chunks. Place the plantain chunks in a pot of salted water and boil them until they are tender when pierced with a fork, about 15-20 minutes. Drain the cooked plantains.</ol>
    <ol>Mash the Plantains: In a large bowl, mash the cooked plantains using a potato masher or fork. Add the butter or oil and mix it into the mashed plantains.</ol>
    <ol>Add Cheese and Onion: Stir in the grated cheese and finely chopped onion into the mashed plantains. The cheese will start to melt from the residual heat of the plantains.</ol>
    <ol>Add Milk and Seasoning: Gradually add the milk to the mixture while stirring, until you achieve a creamy and cohesive texture. If needed, you can adjust the amount of milk to your preferred consistency.
        - Season the tigrillo with salt and pepper to taste.</ol>
    <ol>Optional Additions: If desired, you can incorporate cooked scrambled eggs or cooked chorizo into the tigrillo for added protein and flavor.</ol>
    <ol>Serve: Serve the tigrillo warm. It's often accompanied by slices of avocado and aji hot sauce on the side. -Tigrillo can be enjoyed as a breakfast dish, a light meal, or a side dish alongside other Ecuadorian specialties.</ol>
