  <p>Seco de Pollo is a popular Ecuadorian dish that translates to "chicken stew." It's a flavorful and aromatic dish that showcases the rich culinary heritage of Ecuador. The dish is known for its tender, slow-cooked chicken pieces simmered in a fragrant sauce made from a blend of ingredients such as onions, peppers, garlic, and various spices. The name "seco" refers to the reduction of the sauce during cooking, resulting in a flavorful and concentrated gravy-like consistency.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>2-3 pounds chicken pieces (legs, thighs, or a combination)</ul>
    <ul>1 large red onion, finely chopped</ul>
    <ul>2-3 cloves garlic, minced</ul>
    <ul>1 red bell pepper, diced</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon ground cumin</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon ground achiote (annatto) or paprika</ul>

    <ol>Simmer the Chicken: Return the seared chicken pieces to the pot. Add the dried oregano and chopped cilantro. Pour in the chicken broth and beer (or water).</ol>
