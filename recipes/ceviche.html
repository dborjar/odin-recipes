  <p>Ceviche is a popular and refreshing dish originating from the coastal regions of Latin America, particularly Peru. It's made by marinating raw fish or seafood in citrus juices, primarily lime or lemon juice, which "cooks" the seafood through a process of denaturation. The result is a flavorful and zesty dish with a delicate balance of textures and aromatics. Ceviche is often enjoyed as an appetizer or light meal, especially during warm weather.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>1 pound (450g) fresh white fish fillets (such as sea bass, snapper, or tilapia), diced into bite-sized pieces</ul>
    <ul>1 cup freshly squeezed lime or lemon juice (about 8-10 limes/lemons)</ul>
    <ul>1 small red onion, thinly sliced</ul>
    <ul>1-2 fresh hot chilies (such as jalape√±o or serrano), seeds removed and finely chopped</ul>
    <ul>1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves    </ul>
    <ul>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</ul>
    <ul>Optional: 1 ripe avocado, diced</ul>
    <ul>Optional: Diced tomatoes, diced mango, or other fruits for added flavor and texture</ul>
  <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>Prepare the Fish: Ensure the fish fillets are fresh and of high quality. Remove any bones and skin, and dice the fish into uniform bite-sized pieces.</ol>
    <ol>Marinate the Fish: In a glass or non-reactive bowl, place the diced fish and cover it with the freshly squeezed lime or lemon juice. The fish should be fully submerged in the juice. Allow the fish to marinate in the refrigerator for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</ol>
    <ol>Add Aromatics: Drain off most of the citrus juice. Add the thinly sliced red onion, chopped chilies, and chopped cilantro to the marinated fish. Mix gently to combine.</ol>
    <ol>Season and Chill: Season the ceviche with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. You can also add diced tomatoes, diced avocado, or other fruits if desired. Mix gently to combine all the ingredients.</ol>
    <ol>Serve: Serve the ceviche immediately in small individual bowls or on a plate. You can accompany it with tortilla chips, tostadas, or crispy plantain chips for scooping.</ol>
